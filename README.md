# RetailerRewards
Please find the attached jar file with name RetailerRewards which needs the file path as an argument to run the utility which calculates the reward points, summarises the points customer wise and monthly customer wise.

The transaction file should be of a very simple csv format with 3 fields. First field is Customer Id, Second is the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and thrid is the amount of transaction.

Please note that the utility throws an exception when you don't send the file path as an argument. It also doesn't halt the exceution for the sake of one record with invalid formatted date but it logs the details into standard output terminal.
